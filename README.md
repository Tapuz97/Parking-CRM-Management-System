# Parking CRM Management System

## Introduction

**Parking CRM Management System** is a Java-based, full-stack application designed to manage automated parking operations. It enables subscribers to reserve, drop off, and retrieve vehicles, while assistants and administrators monitor and manage real-time activity, generate visual reports, and handle parking logistics ‚Äî all with a professional dark-mode UI and robust server-side architecture.

## Features

### üßç Subscriber Portal

- **QR-Based Access**: Login and identify using a personal QR code (powered by [ZXing](https://github.com/zxing/zxing)).
- **Vehicle Drop-Off**: Scan QR at the terminal, receive parking code, and leave the car.
- **Vehicle Pickup**: Enter the code to retrieve the car. Lost code recovery via email/SMS.
- **Smart Reservations**: Book parking spots at least 24 hours and up to 7 days in advance with availability logic and auto-expiration.
- **Activity History**: View previous parking sessions and update contact details.
- **Dark Mode**: All interfaces use a sleek, night-friendly UI theme.

### üÖøÔ∏è Assistant Interface

- **Live Monitoring**: View all parked cars, user sessions, and parking durations.
- **Subscriber Management**: Search and inspect users and history.
- **Dark Mode**: Consistent dark theme across all screens.

### üìä Manager Dashboard

- **Visual Analytics**: Auto-generated monthly reports of usage, delays, and status changes.
- **CSV Export**: Download raw and aggregated data.
- **Dark Mode**: Professional dark styling for prolonged usage.

### üñ•Ô∏è Automated Server (with GUI)

- **Connection Log Viewer**: Live view of all client-server connections, with active/disconnected filtering.
- **Log Export**: Export full logs to CSV for analysis.
- **Notification API**: Sends order updates (e.g., delays) via Discord webhook or other APIs.
- **Mailing System**: Email/SMS simulation for password recovery and notifications.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Core modules like DB handler and logger follow Singleton architecture.
- **Crash Handling**: Central exception logging and graceful shutdown logic for fault tolerance.
- **OCSF-Based Architecture**: Reliable Java client-server framework.

## Client-Server Communication

All communication between the client and server is performed over TCP using OCSF sockets.
Messages are encoded and decoded as structured JSON objects using [Google Gson](https://github.com/google/gson), allowing easy command routing and response parsing.

## Included Project Files

This repository includes everything needed to run and test the system:

- ‚úÖ `Park_CRM/` ‚Äì Full Java source code including `client`, `server`, and `shared` modules.
- ‚úÖ `Park_Jar/` ‚Äì Compiled runnable JARs for the system.
- ‚úÖ `Park_DB/` ‚Äì Full MySQL schema and table dump (run as .sql script).
- ‚úÖ `TestingScriptsDB/` ‚Äì Additional SQL scripts to modify the DB for testing.
- ‚úÖ `Park_JavaDoc/` ‚Äì Auto-generated Javadoc for all classes.
- ‚úÖ `README.md` ‚Äì This file, with detailed instructions.
